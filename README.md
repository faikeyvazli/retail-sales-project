# retail-sales-project
This project aims to predict future sales for a retail store using historical sales data.

The process will involve:
- performing EDA on the given dataset (using SQL, then Python)
- building the ML model, making predictions, testing the accuracy
- building the dashboard based on the findings

For now, the basic EDA using SQL has been performed.
You can access the saved query, along with the dataset from this link:
